to build a VPC with mutiple subnes 
configure a firewall and launch a VM web server than anyone can reach

## Enviroment details

- Project name: playground-app
- Region used: us-central
- VPC Name: test-labs
- Subnets Created
	-Subnet a (IP Range 10.1.1.0/24)
	-Subnet b (IP Range 10.1.2.0/24)
- VM Name: Likkle-man
- Public IP Enabled? Yes

#How it works
I created a main network with two separate regional areas
In one area, I spun up a server and opened the firewall 
so web traffic (HTTP) could get in

# what i did (step by step)
- Created a custom VPC network - in the configeration of the vpc 
i set up two subnets with their own IP ranges 
(this can be done out of the VPC but felt it was more efficent to 
do it this way) 
- Opened up the firewall for webtraffic (TCP port 80)
- Created a VM inside Subnet-a 
- installed Nginx (the web server) on the VM 
- confirmed it worked by entering the public IP
in a web browser from a different device

##Key Takeaways 
- VPC are global, but Subnets live in specific regions 
- Firewalls control what goes in and out 
- To make somthing accessable to the public in GCP it needs an external IP
- you need administrator privilages to install software on linus
sudo 

##What broke and how i fixed it
- "premission Denied" error when trying to update the server 
*Remedy* typed sudo before the comand to inisiate admin
- Web page wouldn't load
checked all configuraion to ensure that it was configured correctly 
only to ind out my IP address was a https request and not a http

##Final thoughts 
simple mistakes can seem overwhelimg but taking time and 
confimring the process is fun and solving the problem is rewarding
