# Week 1 – Day 1
## Topic: GCP Structure

## 1. Objective
What was I trying to understand today?
GCP Hierarchy Organisation---> Folder---> Project---> Resources

## 2. Key Concepts

### Organization
(The Parent Level) The top of the hierarchy, represents your entiere company (e.g Swift Pay) there can only be one organisation 
& it holds everything else inside of it 

### Folder
(The Departments) The second level, its how you owuld section of bsuiness arears ( Engineering finance Marketing)
this can also have sub folders below them to have more persional sections like (Payments, Fruad and Mobile inside engineering) 
alloing you to isolate teams and apply security rules to specific groups

### Project
(The Enviroments) This is where the could work starts to happen and the main billing happens you could seperate your payments team into (payment-prod, Payments-staging ect)
increasing security and containg premissions in smaller niches, if someone accidently delets payment-prod, staging still exists.

### IAM
(identity access managment) a security framework used for access/ premissions for human (principal) or device (Service account), controled by administrators to enable who has access to what resource
Its sort of like giving an employee a card key for an office building that only allows them in specific rooms they need to be in, it also controls what the person can do when they are inside the room 

Who- who or what gets a key card (identity)
What – what the key card can do  (Role)
Were- which “doors” can the key card open  (resource)

Uses the premise of giving people or devices exactly whet they need to conduct their work and no more


## 3. What I Did Practically
- Set up a Quota and alert on my GCP 
- Logged into GCP
- Explored IAM section
- Viewed project settings
- built and deployed VM instance 

## 4. What Confused Me
N/A 

## 5. Mental Model
- Organization: The top-level Property Management Company. It owns the entire portfolio.
- Folders: Regional groupings. For example, dividing the portfolio into "Wales Properties" and "Scotland Properties"
  (sub folders "areas in wales" & "areas in Scotland") 
- Projects The inividual rental house, what happnes to a house in scotland doesn't effect the house in wales
- Resources, whats inside the houes boiler sofa fridge ect 

- IAM The keys to the house (who has access Tennant Living there, plumber there just to fix the boiler) and the tennancy aggrement (what they can do inside the property)

- Billing the Gas, eletrice & water attached to the house
- Networking The priveate roads connecting the properties 

If you demolish a house (a Project), all the appliances inside are destroyed, and the utility meter stops billing immediately.
